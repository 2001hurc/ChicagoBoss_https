Upgrade: From 0.4.x to 0.4.y
----------------------------

Starting with Chicago Boss 0.4, application upgrades are as simple as:

   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/[a-z]* .

In general, files in the project directory that start with an upper-case letter
belong to Boss. Files which start with a lower-case letter belong to you.


Upgrade: From 0.3 to 0.4
------------------------

The directory structure has changed somewhat. The MVC files have moved around, and
files for the /admin interface are in a separate directory (ADMIN). 

The following steps should get you most of the way to an upgrade:

   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/boss.config .
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Web/*_controller.erl controller/
   rm controller/admin_controller.erl
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Web/*.erl lib/
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Model/* model/
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/Web/*_views view/
   rm -r view/admin_views
   cp -a /path/to/old/ChicagoBoss/static/* static/
   make clean
   make
