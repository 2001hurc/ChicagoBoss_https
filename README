= GETTING STARTED WITH CHICAGO BOSS =

Dependencies:

    * Erlang R13 -
        http://www.erlang.org/download.html

        Check with erlang:system_info(otp_release).

    * Tokyo Tyrant -
        http://1978th.net/tokyotyrant/

    ** You need Tyrant up and running with a Table database. **

Build Chicago Boss with "make".

Open up boss.config to set your database info and the port you want to run the
server on. When you're ready to rock and roll, run ./start-dev.sh in this
directory. There will be a lot of PROGRESS REPORTs which look scary but
hopefully everything is running smoothly. With this console you can interact
directly with the running server. Next, point your browser to:

http://localhost:8001/hello/world

If all is well you will see "Hello, World!" Now you can get busy. See the FAQ
and API files located in doc/.
