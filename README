    http://1978th.net/tokyotyrant/

    You need Tyrant up and running with a Table database.

Open up boss.config to set your database info and the port you want to run the
server on. When you're ready to rock and roll, run ./start-dev.sh in this
directory. There will be a lot of PROGRESS REPORTs which look scary but
hopefully everything is running smoothly. With this console you can interact
directly with the running server. Next, point your browser to:

http://localhost:8001/hello/world

If all is well you will see "Hello, World!" Now you can get busy. See the FAQ
and API files located in site/boss_doc/.
