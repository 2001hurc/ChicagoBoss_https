The Database README
===================

By default Chicago Boss uses an in-memory database, which is useful for
development and testing but not much else.


Using Tokyo Tyrant
------------------

Tokyo Tyrant is a non-relational database developed by FAL Labs.

1. Download and install Tokyo Tyrant from <http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/>

2. Open up boss.config and set db_driver to boss_db_driver_tyrant


Using Mnesia (EXPERIMENTAL)
---------------------------

Notes:

1. The erlang VM needs a name to run Mnesia (-name or -sname option on the erl command)

2. There needs to be a cookie set (file .erlang.cookie) even on a single node db

3. Open up boss.config and set db_driver to boss_db_driver_mnesia
