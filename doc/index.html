                <p class="question">So, what's the latest?</p>
                <p>A little birdie told me that <strong>Chicago Boss 0.3</strong> is out. If a fella was to visit the <a href="download.html">Download page</a>, he may or may not be able to find a tar-ball with a README file taped inside. Word on the street is, there's a new guide for new guys, too. If it were to exist, it might be called <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/chicago-boss-guide.html">&#8220;An Evening With Chicago Boss&#8221;</a>.</p>

                <p class="question">Version 0.3? What happened to 0.1 and 0.2?</p>
                <p>Who are you, the Bureau of Missing Versions?</p>

                <p class="question">How is Chicago Boss different from Rails/Django/Mason/CakePHP/My Favorite MVC Framework?</p>
                <p>All right, enough with the Boss-speak, I'll give it to you straight: Chicago Boss was designed by a <strong>poor grad student</strong> to handle <strong>lots of traffic</strong> on <strong>minimal hardware</strong>. Like Nginx or Memcached, Chicago Boss uses an <strong>event-driven <nobr>I/O</nobr> strategy</strong> to handle hundreds or thousands of simultaneous requests, and thus it solves the classic <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">c10k</a> problem. Chicago Boss is built with <strong>Erlang</strong>, the same platform used by banks and telecoms to achieve 99.9999999% reliability.</p>

                <p class="question">How mature is Chicago Boss?</p>

                <p>Chicago Boss is <strong>still in beta</strong>. There might be minor changes to the API before the 1.0 release, but it's being used on (admittedly low-traffic) production sites.</p>

                <p class="question">Wait, will I need to learn new things to use Chicago Boss? Please don't make me learn new things.</p>

                <p><strong>Yes and no.</strong> Chicago Boss has ripped off several Rails programming conventions (like <a href="api-record.html">ActiveRecord</a>) as well as the complete <a href="api-view.html">Django Template Language</a> in order to make your life as easy as possible. But you need to know at least a little Erlang to do anything useful with Boss.</p>

                <p class="question">Does Chicago Boss support MySQL/Postgres/Ingres/CouchDB/Microsoft Excel?</p>

                <p>No/No/No/No/No! Boss refuses to talk to anyone except <strong>Tokyo Tyrant</strong>. Check out the <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/chicago-boss-guide.html#meet-tyrant">section on Tyrant</a> in the "Evening With Chicago Boss" for installation instructions.</p>

                <p class="question">Where can I download Chicago Boss?</p>
